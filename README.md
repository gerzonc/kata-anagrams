# kata-anagrams
This repository contains an exercise for the Application Development Trends course

## Description

As part of the final exam, we had to solve [this](http://codekata.com/kata/kata06-anagrams/) kata without including the part of finding the longest words that are anagrams nor finding the set of anagrams containing the most words.

## Installation

In order to install this project all you have to do it's clone the project in your PC and open the .sln file. The application reads a .TXT format file named ```"wordlist.txt"``` that it's placed in ``` "kata-anagrams\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1" ```. You can change this if you want to test the app.
